The model needs a checkpoint file to run, which includes all the weights. The checkpoint file is too large for Github, so there's a link to Baidu Drive: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1LrvIVC_fdTAlYcRoEAKNLQ#list/path=%2F (提取码: u6wa)
This package is copied and modified based on this repo: https://github.com/ShenhanQian/Lane_Detection-An_Instance_Segmentation_Approach/blob/master/README.md.
The main modifications eliminate the need for the CUDA and TuSimple datasets.
